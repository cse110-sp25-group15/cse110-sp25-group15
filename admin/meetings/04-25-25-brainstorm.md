## Pros and Cons 


| Idea | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|----------|
| *RMP for UCSD*     | Easily searchable by class and department| RMP already has a lot of data available,  have to keep adding professors constantly    |
| *Flashcard*     | Specific to UCSD is valuable,  Lowers scope of problem with old data and questions    |  Will need a lot of people to start, all students may not want to post notes and past   |
| *Job App Tracker*   | Immediately applicable to students, can be expanded beyond UCSD students    | Needs heavy automation, complex to implement, privacy conerns     |
| *Yelp for the indecisive*  | WhenToMeet for restaurants   | Difficult to get restaurants data, too technically hard to execute      |
| *Typing Test Website*    | Gamified and interesting, no data acquistion, easy to design     | Pre-exisiting solutions available     |
| *UCSD market place*   |  High utility, can be expanded beyond UCSD  | Needs a lot of users to get started, heavily dependent on user traffic     |
| *Triton Tracks*    | High utility, scalable, can be expanded beyond UCSD     | Extremely hard to implement because of real-time data and location, difficult to connect with other services     |
| *Collaboration Calendar* |  High utlity, scalable    | Heavily dependent on user traffic, solution looking for a problem   |
| *Notion for UCSD* | Can be expanded outside UCSD, shareable across students     | Very broad direction, too many potential features, note-taking apps are very competivitve     |
