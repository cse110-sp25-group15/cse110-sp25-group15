## Retrospective

### What Went Well  
- Haoyan: Modified a new column for listings to be non-nullable and more specific than a standard string.  
- Dhruv: Implemented sorting of listings by price and added 3 sample listings to the database.  
- Anthony: Successfully created listings and pushed the related branch.  
- Kiichiro: Made solid progress with the listing creation form (over 50% done).  
- Nasser: Finished building a static version of the landing page locally.  
- Ahmed: Created sort-by buttons and category filters on the frontend.  
- Hetvi: Chat widget now includes timestamps, read/unread signals, search bar, and escape functionality.  
- Pantea: Added backend logic for sorting listings by listing date.  
- Aniruddha: Implemented backend logic to sort listings by condition.  
- Damian: Restricted listing creation to logged-in UCSD students only.  
- Adam: Enabled responsive image scrolling on the product viewer.

### What Could Be Improved  
- Dhruv: Sorting logic works on backend but needs frontend integration.  
- Anthony: Unit tests and cosmetic improvements are still pending.  
- Kiichiro: Form needs to be completed before the next sprint cycle.  
- Nasser: Landing page changes are still local — needs to be pushed and tested via `npm run dev`.  
- Ahmed: Listings are rendering as blank on the frontend — needs investigation.  
- Hetvi: Chat feature is still static and not hooked into backend logic.  
- Pantea & Aniruddha: Sorting logic needs to be wired into the frontend.  
- Damian: Still need to implement image upload and finalize enum setup for the category field.  
- Adam: Arrows on product viewer malfunctioned during the demo and need fixing.

### Action Items  
- Backend team: Finalize all logic, polish endpoints, and begin implementing the search feature.  
- Frontend team: Refine UI components, integrate backend features (sorting, listing data), and add animations.  
- Everyone: Try to finish tasks ahead of time to allow space for architecture/design changes.  
- All: Details and planning to be discussed further during Tuesday's brainstorm session.

**Note-taker**: Dhruv Agarwal
