## Retrospective

### What Went Well  
- A new pull request workflow and PR template have been created and added to the team channel.  
- Profile section is on track to be completed by Thursday/Friday, unblocking Dhruv's logic testing for fetching all listings of a user and deleting a listing.  
- Most of the issues for the second spring cycle are completed or will be completed by tonight. 

### What Could Be Improved  
- Landing page is consuming excessive data and has slow load times — needs optimization.  
- General code quality across the project needs improvement and standardization.
- Chat widget is currently static and needs logic to hook into authentication.  
- Current login does not restrict to UCSD students — need to validate for `@ucsd.edu` emails.  
- Videos on the platform need compression without compromising quality.

### Action Items  
- Optimize the landing page performance and reduce unnecessary data loading.  
- Add validation to ensure only users with UCSD emails can log in.  
- Hide chatbox until user is authenticated.  
- Ensure price fields display with a dollar sign by default.  
- Continue development on the drag-and-drop component for listings.  
- Explore compression tools/methods to maintain video quality.  
- Encourage use of the new PR workflow and attend code review sessions if needed.
