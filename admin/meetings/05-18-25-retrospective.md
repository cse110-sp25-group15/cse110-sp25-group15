## Retrospective

### What Went Well  
- Team members were able to **work independently while maintaining frequent communication** through Discord and meetings.  
- **Backend and frontend coordination improved**, with clearer expectations for how features should interact.  
- Many team members were able to **unblock themselves** and support each other with debugging or implementing features outside their original scope.  
- New members **took more ownership** of their assigned sections this sprint, demonstrating increased confidence and understanding of the codebase.  
- The overall **morale and collaboration** have improved as responsibilities and workflows are becoming more defined.

### What Could Be Improved  
- Some confusion remains about **where responsibilities begin and end** between backend and frontend for features like sorting and filtering.  
- Certain components are **still under-integrated** — several implemented features are backend-only and waiting on frontend hooks.  
- A few branches have pending updates or weren’t pushed in time for the team to test or review before the meeting.  
- Time management could be improved — some developers began tasks late in the sprint, leading to last-minute scrambles.  
- Inconsistent **test coverage and documentation** is starting to cause friction as new contributors pick up unfamiliar areas of code.

---

## Action Items  
- **Clarify responsibilities** across layers for key features to avoid redundant or incomplete implementations.  
- Push updates and WIP branches earlier in the sprint, even if incomplete, to allow shared feedback.  
- Improve **test-writing discipline** across the team — every new feature should come with minimal test coverage and documentation.  
- Use the Sunday/Monday code review sessions actively to improve code quality and identify integration issues early.  
- Maintain a shared document for listing blockers and reaching out early when stuck.  
- Discuss workflow/process friction points in Tuesday’s brainstorm to improve the sprint structure.
