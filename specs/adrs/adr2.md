# ADR 2: UCSD Online MarketPlace

**Date:** 8 May, 2025  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Deciders:** 10X Brogrammers Team (Team 15)


## Context
- We are building an online UCSD marketplace for buying/selling/trading clickers, school merch, calculators and other academic and non-academic UCSD materials.

## Proposal
- Implement a chat feature in the marketplace so that interested buyer can contact the seller.


## Rationale
- Chat feature makes it easy to contact and does away with the need to send a separate email.
- It makes the app experience better and integrated the interface better. 
- Can also integrate WhatsApp or FaceBook messenger in the marketplace itself to streamline the process. 


## Potential Downsides
- Difficult to implement as it is technically challenging. 
- Messaging feature would not work when offline. 
- Some students may be hesitant to provide contact information publicly to all UCSD students.

## Alternatives Considered
- Have contact details (email ID, phone number, instagram handle) already mentioned under every listing.
