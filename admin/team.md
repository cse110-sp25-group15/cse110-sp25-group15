## 🌐 About Us

Welcome to the official team page for **10X Brogrammers**, where we compile ideas, squash all bugs (only for debugging purposes mostly), and caffeine flows through our veins. We are a team of passionate developers who value:

- 💡 **Clarity** – Write code that makes sense (even two weeks later).
- 🤝 **Collaboration** – Great software is built together.
- 🧐 **Curiosity** – Always ask why (and how).
- ☕️ **Caffeine** – Our primary programming language.

## 🎯 Team Values

- **Transparency**: No surprises, just syncs.
- **Ownership**: If you break it, you fix it, you inform. And write a test.
- **Humor**: If we’re not laughing, we’re debugging (but then we are crying).
