## Potential Issues

- Kiichi may not be available on Sunday of Week 7 but has informed in advance. 
- Pantea may not be available on one of the Fridays but has informed in advance.


## Conflict Resolution Strategy 
- First, reach out to the teammate and try to understand their situation.
- If there is no response, bring the matter to the TA.
- Always assume good intentions.

## Situations when rules are not followed
- If due to technical roadblocks: suggest tutorials and pair programming with other team members.
- If due to time commitments: flexibility is allowed once (maximum twice), but consistent contribution is expected. 
- Assign tasks according to interest and proficiency level to ensure efficiency. 


## Measure of Success

- ***Week 10 Spring Cycle:*** Take inputs from the TA and finishing touches.
